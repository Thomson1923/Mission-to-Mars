# Mission-to-Mars

# TO THE GRADER - Out of respect for your time and patience, DO NOT spend too long reviewing the deliverables for this challenge. Despite spending more hours on this challenge than almost any other, I had little or no success with several tasks. I will not recite the difficulties (probably self-inflicted) that I encountered. The likelihood of receiving a very low grade is just a part of life in the data analytics bootcamp.
# That said, I found this web scraping module very interesting and will spend time over the Christmas holidays trying to resolve my technical issues.
